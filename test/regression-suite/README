This is the regression test suite for x3dom.
It runs the test cases in x3dom, creates screenshots, stores them in the output folder and compares them to reference images.
A results page and diffs are created alongside the screenshots in the browsers subfolder (e.g. output/Chrome).
The overview page is adjusted for the server folder structure.

Prerequisites:
-currently only windows is supported
-JRE(any version)
-node.js(only 32Bit works at the moment!)
-Browsers
-x3dom

Installation:
-no installation is required, but some points should be noted:
-this suite must reside in the x3dom project in x3dom/test/regression-suite
-changing this requires path adaptations in src/server.js, configuration.json and the test-cases

Execution:
-execute run.bat to run the tests
-run_conservative.bat runs the test with different parameters, adjusted for the daily build.

Parameters:
-c, --conservative : adds a one second delay before screenshoting to give x3dom time to finish XHRs (loading textures, inlines).
-m, --no-aa : change the directory of reference images to reference-no-aa (for virtual graphics card on server-vm).
